	\subsection*{Abstract:}
		– Summarize motivation and main results.
	
	\newpage
	
	\subsection*{Introduction:}
		– State motivation – why you did this work?\\
		– Describe physics phenomena and methods of study.\\
		– Cover all investigations, keep short.\\
	\subsection*{Experimental Data:} 
		– For each investigation: Discuss experimental set-up.\\
		– Explain experimental procedure.\\
		– Describe how the data were collected.\\
		– Include all data using graphs/tables, with titles.\\
		– If needed, include truncated raw data into Appendix.\\
	\subsection*{Analysis:}
		– Summarize physics concepts under investigation.\\
		– Discuss relation between data and theory.\\
		– Describe techniques used to analyze data.\\
		– Discuss sources/values of uncertainties in your measurement.\\
		– Write down main results with uncertainties.\\
		– Compare measured quantities to expected values.\\
		– Discuss if they match or not your expectations.\\
		– List the unaccounted factors in your analysis.\\
		– Argue why and how external factors may affect the results.\\
	\subsection*{Conclusion:}
		– List physical concepts that have been investigated.\\
		– Summarize all main results that you obtained.\\
		– Discuss how external factors might have skewed the results.\\
		– Discuss possible improvements.\\
		– Keep to half a page.\\
	\subsection*{Questions:}
		– Answer all questions at the end of experiment in the IPL Manual.\\
		– Type all necessary algebra, not just the answer.\\
		– Honors sections must answer extra question.
